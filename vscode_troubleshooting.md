# VS Code Tailwind CSS Troubleshooting

If you are still experiencing issues with Tailwind CSS IntelliSense in VS Code, please follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem:

## 1. Install Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Extension

Make sure you have the official **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** extension installed. You can install it from the VS Code Marketplace.

1.  Open the **Extensions** view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X).
2.  Search for "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense".
3.  Click **Install** on the extension published by "Tailwind Labs".

## 2. Reload VS Code

After installing the extension or making changes to the configuration, it's important to reload VS Code.

1.  Open the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P).
2.  Type "Developer: Reload Window" and press Enter.

## 3. Clear VS Code Cache

Sometimes, VS Code can cache old configurations. Clearing the cache can help resolve this issue.

1.  Close all instances of VS Code.
2.  Locate the cache directory for your operating system:
    *   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\Cache` and `%APPDATA%\Code\CachedData`
    *   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/Cache` and `~/Library/Application Support/Code/CachedData`
    *   **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/Cache` and `~/.config/Code/CachedData`
3.  Delete the contents of these directories.

## 4. Restart VS Code

After clearing the cache, restart VS Code. The Tailwind CSS IntelliSense should now be working correctly.

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, please let me know.
